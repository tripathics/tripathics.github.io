# My homepage and blog

#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:

The final project for CS50 is my own homepage and blogging website. 

The journey of this project began with the **week 8 of CS50X course** with HTML, CSS and JS. I started writing the styles, from buttons to navigation bar, all from scratch, coming accross many portfolios and homepages, taking inspiration from them. I was struggling to create CS50X like left side navigation. 

**Then came week 9: Flask**. It was such a relief. I got to know about templates and learnt that developers don't keep copying navbars to each page of their website after adding a new link. At this time I created a [repository](https://github.com/tripathics/homepage) for my project on Github. 

Later I discovered the CSS Grid and used CSS Grid template area for the layout of my website. Created yet another [repository](https://github.com/tripathics/homepage-grid). Then I wrote my own static site generator for blogs written in markdown using the [markdown-it js library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it). I could now write blogs in markdown with some of my own syntax for tags like `<kbd>` and the static site generator would create the jinja template which later was served by the flask application. 

I was hoping to submit this as my final project but I again started to change the codebase to ReactJS and Gatsby - which is an awesome static site generator with GraphQL support. The website is now live at: [tripathics.github.io](https://tripathics.github.io) and the source files are in the src branch of my [tripathics.github.io](https://github.com/tripathics/tripathics.github.io/tree/src/) repository.
